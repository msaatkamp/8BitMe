This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief History

This project was created to study purposes, the objective is to learn more about canvas and javascript functions that could be used to produce a simple game.
I may end up creating some helpful functions and reusing them in another project. 

If things go right I`ll end up writing some personal stuff inside a simple 2D classic RPG like this.
